This is a budgeting website that I am building and will eventually upload to SimpleWeeklyBudget.com.  The website will reflect a pretty cool weekly budget that my wife and I have found very useful.  It has allowed us to spend money on the things we want more freely because we can know exactly how much we have set aside to spend each week.  Once I get it up and running, I hope it will help others to enjoy their money a little more comfortably, as my wife and I have been able to do.
