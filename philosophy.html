			How much should you be spending each week?  We're here to help you find out.
		</h2>
		<p>
			  Once you decide exactly how much to spend each week, it becomes a lot easier to balance the trade-offs that come with a finite amount of money.  Should I buy this new shirt, or go out to eat for lunch today, or save my spending cash for a great dinner Friday night at that new spot everyone’s been talking about?  We know most of your bills are monthly but don’t worry; we’ve got an easy system to help you track your budget weekly while still paying your monthly bills.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Rather than constraining yourself to tens of categories, we recommend that you break up your income into just four. 
			<ul> 
				<li>Bills and Monthly Expenses</li>
				<li>Short-Term Savings</li>
				<li>Long-Term Savings and Investments</li>
				<li>Everything Else</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Most bills are monthly, so <u>the first thing you should do each and every month is set aside all of the money you will need to pay those bills you know are coming.</u>  Some of you may prefer to actually put this money in a seperate checking account or even an envelope.  You're welcome to do so if you prefer, but it’s not necessary.  Just make sure you know how much to save for those monthly bills.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not every expense is small enough to fit into a weekly budget.  To account for this, it’s important that you <u>set aside a percentage of your income for those big expenses</u>.  We recommend setting aside about 10% of your income (after taxes) for those bigger expenses.  Depending on your income, spending habits, and financial goals, you may need to contribute more or less to your “Big-Expense Fund”.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to your “Big-Expense Fund”, <u>you should also be contributing monthly to your long-term savings or investments</u>.  The amount you save is going to depend a lot on your personal goals and financial situation.  If your not sure how much to save, try a good retirement calculator like this one.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you’ve accounted for your monthly bills, savings, and investments, you can easily determine how much money you should be spending monthly and weekly based on your income.  <b><a href="calculator.html">Our Budget Calculator</a> is designed to help you get started.  It will calculate how much you can afford to spend based on your inputs.</b>  Then, all you have to do is take out that much money each week and spend only that money.  Or you can move that money to a seperate checking account, debit card, or just keep track of how much you spend on your credit card.  
		</p>
		<p>
			We hope you’ll find this budgeting strategy as simple, effective, and liberating as we have.
